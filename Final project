# Final Project

Iâ€™ll use two datasets, AB_NYC_2019.csv (2019 data) and NYC-Airbnb-2023.csv (2023 data), to explore how Airbnb prices in NYC have changed over time. \n
I want to find out which neighborhoods have the highest prices, how property types affect pricing, and whether factors like availability or host activity make a difference. \n 
The goal is to understand what drives Airbnb prices, how the market has evolved, and what insights we can give to both hosts and guests.\n

## Host Analysis
* Most Listings: Who are the top hosts with the most listings, and how are their properties distributed across neighborhoods?
* Highest Revenue Potential: Which host has the highest potential revenue based on price and availability, and how are their properties distributed?
* Highest-Priced Property: Which host owns the most expensive listing, and in which neighborhood?

## Neighborhood Analysis:
* Concentration of Listings: Which neighborhoods have the most Airbnb listings, and how has this changed from 2019 to 2023?
* Highest Average Price: Which neighborhoods consistently have the highest prices, and what factors influence this (e.g., property type, host activity)?

## Property Type Analysis:
* Most Popular Type: Which property type has the most listings, and how are they distributed across neighborhoods?
* Highest Average Price: Which property type commands the highest average price, especially within neighborhoods?
* Year-Round Availability: Which property type is available year-round the most?

## Time-Based Trends:
* Pricing Changes: How have prices changed over time for neighborhoods and property types (2019 vs. 2023)?
* Price vs. Availability: Is there a relationship between higher prices and year-round availability?

## Guest Interaction and Reviews:
* Most Reviews: Which listings have the highest number of reviews, and what are their locations, property types, and prices?
* Review Correlation: Does the number of reviews relate to the price or availability of a property?
