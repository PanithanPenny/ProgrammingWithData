    "Iâ€™ll use two datasets, AB_NYC_2019.csv (2019 data) and NYC-Airbnb-2023.csv (2023 data), to explore how Airbnb prices in NYC have changed over time. I want to find out which neighborhoods have the highest prices, how property types affect pricing, and whether factors like availability or host activity make a difference. \n",

    "The goal is to understand what drives Airbnb prices, how the market has evolved, and what insights for both hosts and guests.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Host Analysis\n",
    "* Most Listings: Who are the top hosts with the most listings, and how are their properties distributed across neighborhoods?\n",
    "* Highest Revenue Potential: Which host has the highest potential revenue based on price and availability, and how are their properties distributed?\n",
    "* Highest-Priced Property: Which host owns the most expensive listing, and in which neighborhood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Neighborhood Analysis\n",
    "* Concentration of Listings: Which neighborhoods have the most Airbnb listings, and how has this changed from 2019 to 2023?\n",
    "* Highest Average Price: Which neighborhoods consistently have the highest prices, and what factors influence this (e.g., property type, host activity)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Property Type Analysis\n",
    "* Most Popular Type: Which property type has the most listings, and how are they distributed across neighborhoods?\n",
    "* Highest Average Price: Which property type commands the highest average price, especially within neighborhoods?\n",
    "* Year-Round Availability: Which property type is available year-round the most?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Time-Based Trends\n",
    "* Pricing Changes: How have prices changed over time for neighborhoods and property types (2019 vs. 2023)?\n",
    "* Price vs. Availability: Is there a relationship between higher prices and year-round availability?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guest Interaction and Reviews\n",
    "* Most Reviews: Which listings have the highest number of reviews, and what are their locations, property types, and prices?\n",
    "* Review Correlation: Does the number of reviews relate to the price or availability of a property?"
